percival
========
Percival painlessly perceives (perhaps, ‘pretty prints?’) peoples’ precious, preferred possessions.

In other words, Percival is a pretty printer / inspector for JavaScript objects. It supports
printing to the terminal, ANSI colourization, recognizing and demonstrating recursive memberships at
multiple levels, and ‘lenses’ for your own special objects and types.
