Percival
========
Percival painlessly perceives (perhaps, ‘pretty prints?’) peoples’ precious,
preferred possessions.

In other words, Percival is a pretty printer / inspector for JavaScript
objects. It supports printing to the terminal, ANSI colourization, recognizing
and demonstrating recursive memberships at multiple levels, and ‘lenses’ for
your own special objects and types.
